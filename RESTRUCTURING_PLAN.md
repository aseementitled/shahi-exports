## Overview
This document outlines the complete restructuring plan for the Shahi Exports loan and salary advance application based on user feedback. The goal is to create a more intuitive, simplified experience for blue-collar workers.

---

## 🎯 1. REGISTRATION/LOGIN FLOW SEPARATION

### Current State
- Single KYC flow that combines registration and verification
- No distinction between first-time users and returning users

### Planned Changes

#### A. First-Time Registration Flow
```
Language Selection → Registration Options → Details Collection → KYC Setup
```

#### B. Returning User Login Flow
```
Language Selection → Login Options → Dashboard Access
```

### Registration Options

#### Option 1: QR Code Scan
- **Extract Data**: name, mobile, employee number
- **Pre-fill**: Available details from QR code
- **User Input**: Missing information (gender, etc.)
- **Benefits**: Faster, fewer errors, employer integration
- **Hardcoded Data**: 
  - Name: "aseem"
  - Mobile: "8077319041" 
  - Employee ID: "EMP123"

#### Option 2: Mobile + OTP
- **Step 1**: Enter mobile number
- **Step 2**: Simulate fetching user data with loader
- **Step 3**: Show same hardcoded data (aseem, 8077319041, EMP123)
- **Step 4**: Fill additional details manually
- **Benefits**: No QR code dependency, universal access

### Implementation Notes
- Store registration method for future logins
- Maintain session persistence
- Clear error handling for both methods
- **User Flow Logic**:
  - **First-time users**: Show registration options (QR scan or mobile)
  - **Returning users**: Show login options (QR scan or mobile)
  - **Data Simulation**: Both methods return same hardcoded user data
  - **Loader Simulation**: Mobile option shows loading while "fetching" data

## 🌐 2. LANGUAGE SELECTOR FIRST

### Current State
- Language selector appears within pages
- No clear language preference setup
- Language changes during navigation

### Planned Changes

#### New App Structure
```
1. Language Selection Screen (First screen)
   ├── Hindi
   ├── English
   └── [Future: Other regional languages]

2. Then → Registration/Login Options
```

#### Implementation Details
- **Dedicated Page**: Separate language selection screen
- **Immediate Storage**: Store preference instantly
- **Global Application**: Apply to all subsequent screens
- **No Distractions**: No other UI elements until language selected
- **Visual Design**: Large, clear language options with native scripts

#### Benefits

## 🆔 3. KYC FLOW RESTRUCTURE

### Current State
- Assumes all users have documents ready
- No document availability check
- File upload confusion

### Planned Changes

#### New KYC Flow
```
1. Registration Complete
2. Document Availability Check:
   - "Do you have PAN Card?" (Yes/No)
   - "Do you have Aadhaar Card?" (Yes/No)
   - "Are both documents with you now?" (Yes/No)

3. Based on Response:
   - If Yes → Camera-based document capture and file upload also 
   - If No → "Please complete when you have documents ready"

4. Document Capture (Camera and file upload both):
   - PAN Card capture
   - Aadhaar Card capture
5. Document Capture (Camera upload only):
   - Live selfie verification
```

#### Implementation Strategy
